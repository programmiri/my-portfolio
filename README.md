# Hello, I am Mirjam

## This is my portfolio :information_desk_person:
The technology is still pretty much 2018, but it works! In Germany, we have a saying "the cobbler always wears the worst shoes" and I guess that is true for a lot of us Frontend Engineers, too. 

I plan to update my portfolio at some point, but you may know all the things that your developer ðŸ§  goes through then: 
- "Just plain HTML and CSS, because that's the important basics and it's enough for a static page?"
- "Or do I use Vue because that's what I've done the last years and should show of?"
- "Maybe better go React, so that people know I can do that too... but... should I use Gatsby that I'm familiar with because of my side project oder should I get into Next.js because it's _the_ thing??"
- "Wait! Phoenix and Elixir! Finally a good project to play around with that!"
- ...

Soooooo... that's why I'm staying with the existing base right now. 

tbc in the future (I hope) ðŸ˜¬


### First things first
I would be happy if you pay my portfolio at [programmiri.de](http://programmiri.rocks/) a visit. Feel free to get in touch if you have feedback about it.

The portfolio is currently based on a brunch setup I build as an example for two article of mine. Visit the my repository [brunch-setup-bootstrap4](https://github.com/programmiri/brunch-setup-bootstrap4) if you want to learn more about it.

#### Program-what?
*Programmiri* is a old nickname a friend gave me when I build my first website. It's a wordplay with the words "Programming" and "Miri" (for Mirjam). It's not very original, but it kind of stucked  `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`
